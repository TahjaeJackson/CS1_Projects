# Purpose: Question 4

"""
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, â€¦ where every number
is equal to the sum of two numbers before it in the sequence.
In this question define a function print_fibs_decreasing that takes a positive integer n as
parameter and prints all the numbers in Fibonacci series that are between 1 and n in
decreasing order. n is included and your function should print it, if it is a Fibonacci sequence
number. You are not allowed to use Python syntax that has not been discussed in class. For
example:
1. if n = 10, then your function should print
8
5
3
2
1
1
2. if n = 5, then your function should print
5
3
2
1
1
3. if n = 1, then your function should print
1
1
